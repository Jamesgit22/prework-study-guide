# prework-study-guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- As I am learning new skills in my bootcamp, I wanted a central location to store my notes on the various topics that are covered in the prework study guide.
- To do this, I have built a website to enter and view my notes from the study guide.
- In creating this website, I was able to review some programming fundamentals such as basic conditionals, for loops, and writing functions. This also gave me my first real experience with using git and githib to properly manage my project.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The notes are listed by topic in the body of the website. If you would like to view a list of topics covered and recieve a suggestion of which topic to study, open the Chrome Dev Tools on the webpage and select the console tab. Addtionally, you can use keyboard shortcuts to open the chrome dev tools. For MAC, press (Command+Option+I). For Windows, press (Control+Shift+I).
